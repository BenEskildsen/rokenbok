 - panning while zoomed in moves the view more than 1-to-1
 - write selector to convert canvas coord to world coord
 - detect what was clicked on when selecting
 - seed function for bok initial positions
 - miners should drop off at trucks/factories (and turn around?)
 - render which direction trucks/miners are facing
 - only re-render boks when they change (pan/zoom)
 - use a lookup table for collisions with boks instead of comparing to each
 - zoom can save canvas to bitmap and zoom the image instead of re-rendering everything

 - detect collisions
